# midimap
midimap is an Arduino library to simplify use of sensors and actuators in midi environment inspired on 
Arduino library [Control Surface](https://github.com/tttapa/Control-Surface)
At its core is a
[general-purpose MIDI abstraction layer](https://tttapa.github.io/Control-Surface-doc/Doxygen/d3/df7/midi-tutorial.html)
with support for MIDI over USB, which can be
useful for any MIDI-related project.

## Overview

This library turns your Arduino-compatible board into a MIDI control surface.  
Just connect some push buttons, potentiometers, LEDs ... and declare them in
your code.

The following sections give a brief overview of the features of the library.

### MIDI Interfaces

 - **MIDI over USB**

### MIDI Control Output

 - **Push buttons** and **toggle switches**
 - **Potentiometers**, **faders** and other analog sensors
