/**
 * This example demonstrates the use of a MIDI Control Change potentiometer
 * that can be used for changing effect parameters, volume, pan, and balance
 * controls, etc. It can control almost any knob in your DAW software.
 *
 * The ESP32 sends MIDI Control Change (CC) messages **wirelessly** via
 * **Bluetooth MIDI (BLE MIDI)**, allowing for cable-free control.
 *
 * @board  ESP32 (Required for Bluetooth MIDI support)
 *
 * Connections
 * -----------
 *
 * - **A0:** Wiper of a potentiometer
 *
 * Connect the **left terminal** of the potentiometer to **ground (GND)**,
 * and the **right terminal** to **VCC (3.3V)**.
 *
 * Behavior
 * --------
 *
 * - When you turn the potentiometer, you should receive MIDI Control Change
 *   events with values ranging from **0 to 127**.
 * - The analog input is filtered to reduce noise. If you experience jitter,
 *   check your wiring and ensure the potentiometer resistance is **10 kÎ©**.
 *
 * Mapping
 * -------
 *
 * The ESP32 acts as a **Bluetooth MIDI controller**, so you need to pair it
 * with your DAW or music software that supports BLE MIDI.
 *
 * - **MIDI CC Number:** 7 (Channel Volume)
 * - **MIDI Channel:** 1
 *
 * **How to Connect via Bluetooth MIDI:**
 * - On **iOS/macOS**, use **GarageBand** or **MIDI BLE Connect** to pair the ESP32.
 * - On **Windows**, use **MIDI Berry** with a virtual loopback device.
 * - On **Android**, use **MIDI BLE Peripheral**.
 *
 * Once connected, use the **MIDI Learn** feature in your DAW to assign
 * the potentiometer to control any parameter.
